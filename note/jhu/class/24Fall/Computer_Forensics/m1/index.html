It is acceptable to alter evidence sometimes .", answer: "An executive within a company was suspected of fraud, and digital investigators were instructed to acquire a forensic duplicate of his laptop without his knowledge.  It was known that the executive’s laptop was configured with full disk encryption.  Although it would have been technically feasible to shut down the laptop, create a forensic duplicate of the hard drive, and then attempt to decrypt the hard drive using an administrative decryption key, there was insufficient time for this approach.  It was decided that a forensic duplicate would be made of the live laptop while it was left running in the executive’s office after he was called out for an interview relating to the suspected fraud.  Although this process required digital investigators to interact with the laptop, causing changes to be made to the system, it enabled them to acquire all data on the laptop hard drive efficiently in unencrypted form, including deleted data.  During the acquisition process, digital investigators documented their actions in a way that would enable others to assess their work.  In addition, to ensure that the live acquisition process did not have any adverse impact on the evidence, it had been tested prior to being used in an actual investigation.”  (p. 233)"},
