What does the speaker want to do? Say in simple words.
Jiho Shin is working on making new bioelectronic devices. He wants these devices to be thinner, more bendable, and maybe even able to dissolve after use. He is using something called single crystalline semiconductor membranes. He hopes to make devices that are easier and less painful for people to use, like for checking blood pressure or connecting with the nervous system. He also wants to make special sensors that can be put inside the brain.

How do people do this work now, and what are the problems?
Right now, devices like brain implants or sensors you wear are big, stiff, and can't dissolve. This can make people feel uncomfortable and is not very user-friendly. These problems come from the current way of making these devices with thick silicon wafers and inorganic single crystal semiconductors.

What is new in his approach and why does he think it will work well?
Shin's new method uses a special process called epitaxial liftoff to make very thin films of silicon. This makes the bioelectronic devices flexible and possibly dissolvable. He thinks this method will work well because the devices will fit better with our body's tissues and might not need to be removed later, making things easier and safer for patients.

Who would be interested in this and why is it important?
This work is important for biomedical engineers, brain scientists, doctors, and patients. If Shin's research is successful, it could change how bioelectronic devices are used. It could lead to better ways to watch and treat health problems, more comfortable ways to monitor the brain, and new methods to help with nerve diseases and other health issues.
